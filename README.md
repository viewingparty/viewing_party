<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Application

This application allows a user to schedule, create, and invite their friends to movie nights!

After registering with our application, we allow users to:
* Login securely to their account
* Request, approve, and deny other users as their friends
* Browse for any movie they want to watch
   * They can chose to search for movies by name, popularity, or genre!
* Create a movie party and invite their friends to it!

When searching for movies, users can use helpful information to guide their choices, such as:
* The Movie's Theatrical Poster
* Top Billed Cast
* Notable Reviews

While users cannot currently watch the movies they select for their parties through this application, it is our hope that providing an easy and informative application brings their movie night experience one step closer to reality!

* [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
